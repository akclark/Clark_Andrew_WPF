<h1><center>A Little Bit About Me</center></h1><hr />

<p>My name is <strong>Andrew Clark</strong>, I live (and have always lived) in South Bend, IN. I have been married for almost 9 years now to my beautiful wife Shari, and have a 3 year old daughter named Lily.</p>

<p>I have done a large number of things for work since I started working after high school, mostly in retail or construction. I have though, severe seasonal allergies from early spring through late fall, so I have been looking for quite some time for something to do indoors that I can make a living at. I have played around with programming and page layout since I was in Junior High <em>(longer ago now than I care to admit)</em> and have always enjoyed it  but it never occurred to me for some reason that I could do something like that for a job.</p>

<p>This will be my third year attending Ivy Tech (at the moment only able to attend half-time), currently enrolled in the Graphic Design program, but leaning toward switching to Web Design.</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies are:
<ul>
<li>Martial Arts</li>



<li>Reading</li>
<li>Video Games</li>
<li>Wood Turning (on a lathe)</li>
</ul></p>
