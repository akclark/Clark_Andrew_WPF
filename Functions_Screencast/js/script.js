//Intro to Functions

//Functions store stuff like variables do, however variables store values, while functions store blocks of code.
//Functions allow you to have the code in one place and run that code as many times as you want.

//Basic function structure:

function functionName () {
    //code the function runs
}
//parenthesis are for parameters
//functions have names so we can refer to them later

function outputMsg() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}

function calcArea() {
    var width = 20;
    var length = 30;
    var area = width * length;
    console.log(area);
}

//Function Invocation - Telling the function to run

calcArea();//This says to run the function 
calcArea();
calcArea();
